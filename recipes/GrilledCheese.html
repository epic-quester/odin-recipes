    <h3>Italian Marinated Grilled Cheese</h3>
    <p>This Italian marinated grilled cheese is made by briefly marinating 3 kinds of cheese with a quick oil and vinegar dressing, and including a few things you typically find in antipasto. It's a new and amazing twist on the classic grilled cheese sandwich.</p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <h4>Cheese Filling</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>

        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch chili flakes</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried Italian herbs</li>
        <li>2 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, grated</li>
        <li>2 ounces Cheddar cheese, grated</li>
        <li>1 slice provolone, quartered</li>
        <li>1 rounded tablespoon diced roasted red peppers</li>
        <li>1 rounded tablespoon diced pickled pepperoncini peppers</li>
        <li>1 rounded tablespoon diced green olives</li>

        <li>Stir in red peppers, pepperoncini, and olives. Wrap and let marinade in fridge for 15 minutes, or up to several hours.</li>
